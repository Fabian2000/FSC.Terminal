# What is FSC.Terminal?
Terminal is the same like the console class. It uses generics in some methods and offers the possibility to write a hidden password.
You can choose a password char or just use nothing like in the most linux software. Try it out and you will notice how similar it is to the default console class, but still so much advanced
